                <p>There is a noticeable difference between high and low income countries when it comes to achieving universal education, and, despite significant investment in primary education since the turn of the millennium, the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of achieving universal primary education by 2015 has been missed by almost 60% of countries.</p>

                <p>Most of these children would be saved in sub-Saharan Africa, as the largest gains in child health comes from primary and lower-secondary education, improvements of which are already included in the trend scenario for most other continents. </p>

                <p>If universal secondary education could be achieved by 2030 it could bring poverty elimination forward by 10 years.
                <p>If SDG 4.1 was met, the poverty headcount rate (the proportion of the population living below the poverty line of US$1.25 at 2005 purchasing power parity) in low income countries would drop to 24% by 2030, compared to 28% at current trends. By 2050, it would be projected to drop to 2%, instead of the 9% currently forecasted.</p>
                <p>With 875 million people currently living in low income countries, this would lift 60 million people out of poverty.</p>
